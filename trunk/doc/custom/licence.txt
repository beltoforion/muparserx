<b>muParserX</b> is published under the <b>GPL3 Licence</b>. I'm aware that this
will limit it's usefullness for commercial projects. But find this justifiable 
for one simple reason: The original <a href="http://muparser.sourceforge.net">muParser</a> was released under the 
MIT-Licence which is very liberal with regard to using it in commercial products. 
Although muParser is widely used by now the stream of donations coming back 
in support of its development is low to nonexistant (apart from a few
notable exceptions; Thanks to those who donated in the past!). Since my 
time is limited I'm interested in receiving modification, bugfixes 
and additions from peoples actually using the parser. The best way to get 
those modifications is by forcing people to make them publicly available. 
(For instance if someone implements a callback function doing a Fast 
Fourier Transform i would like to be able to use it.)
