  /** \brief The ValueCache class provides a simple mechanism to recycle 
             unused value items.
    
    This class serves as a factory for value items. It allows skipping
    unnecessary and slow new/delete calls by storing unused value 
    objects in an internal buffer for later reuse. By eliminating new/delete
    calls the parser is sped up approximately by factor 3-4.
