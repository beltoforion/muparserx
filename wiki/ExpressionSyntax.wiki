#summary Overview over the expression syntax of muParserX
#sidebar TableOfContents

= Value types =

Internally muparserx is using a variant style datatype which can represent values (complex or not), strings and matrices. 

= String values =

String values can only be used if the parser was  initialized with the [http://code.google.com/p/muparserx/wiki/Using#Parser_initialization pckSTRING] flag. This is the case when using a default initialized parser instance. When used in a parser expression string values must be enclosed in quotation marks as shown in the folowing example:

{{{
"This is a text"
}}}

muparserx can use the backslash character for escaping special characters. The following escape sequences are supported:

|| Escape sequence || Description ||
|| \n || newline ||
|| \r || carriage return ||
|| \t || tabulator  ||
|| \" || quote ||
|| \\ || backslash ||

By using the proper escape sequence creating a string containing two lines can be achieved easily:

{{{
"This is the first line\nThis is the second line"
}}}

Concatenating strings can be done with the operator "//":
{{{
"Hello "//"World"
}}}

= Complex numbers =
When [http://code.google.com/p/muparserx/wiki/Using#Parser_initialization used in complex mode], the parser defines a constant representing the imaginary unit i. This constant can be used exactly like any other variable with the exception that you can omit the {{{'*'}}} between 'i' and values. For instance defining a complex variable a can simply be achieved by using either the short:

{{{
6+9i
}}}

or the long version:

{{{
6+9*i
}}}

= Matrices and arrays =
In order to use matices muparserx must be initialized with the [http://code.google.com/p/muparserx/wiki/Using#Parser_initialization pckMATRIX] flag. This flag will activate the transpose operator and the functions {{{ones}}} which can be used for creating new matrices on the fly.

== Creating new matrices ==

In order to create a new matrix muparser provides a function called ones. Calling this function will create a new m x n matrix filled the number one.

{{{
ones(2,2)
}}}

will yield a 2 x 2 matrix with a 1 in each cell.

Matrix and array values are exactly treated like any other value. The only exception is that they support the index operator. The index operator can either be one or two dimensional, depending on the dimension of the parser variable. When using the index operator on matrices the index dimensions are seperated with a colon. The first index refers to the rows of the matrix, the second to the columns.
{{{
m[1,2]=1
}}}
